This is a detailed technical report and worklog for the **"First Cloud Journey"** program. Designed as a **3-month capability development roadmap**, from **September 8, 2025 to December 7, 2025**, this report simulates the transformation of a system architect from basic cloud concepts to deploying modern, complex architectures on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

From **Week 8 onwards**, alongside AWS learning, I joined the **Voltgo project** - an electric vehicle rental platform. As a **Frontend Developer**, I was responsible for building main interfaces: **User, Login, Booking, Blog, Vehicle, Station**.
