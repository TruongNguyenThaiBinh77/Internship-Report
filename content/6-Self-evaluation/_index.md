### Self-Assessment


During my internship at **AMAZON WEB SERVICES VIETNAM COMPANY LIMITED** from **08/09** to **12/12**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.

I participated in the **VoltGo (EV Station-based Rental System)** project as a **Frontend Developer** (developing Web Dashboard interface). Through this, I significantly improved the following skills:
* **Programming:** Building management interface with **Next.js**, deploying through **AWS Amplify**, and handling API integration.
* **Analysis & Integration:** Deep understanding of data flow between Frontend and AWS services.
* **Report Writing & Documentation:** Skills in documenting components and deployment processes.

Regarding work attitude, I always strive to complete assigned professional tasks. However, I recognize that I need to seriously improve my discipline and work processes to achieve optimal efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship process, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

| No. | Criteria | Description | Good | Fair | Average |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | **Professional knowledge & skills** | Understanding of the field, applying knowledge (Next.js, AWS) in practice, code quality | ✅ | | |
| 2 | **Ability to learn** | Absorbing new technology, learning quickly | | ✅ | |
| 3 | **Proactiveness** | Self-learning, taking on tasks without waiting for instructions | ✅ | | |
| 4 | **Sense of responsibility** | Completing work on time, ensuring quality | ✅ | | |
| 5 | **Discipline** | Adhering to schedules, regulations, work processes | | | ✅ |

### Needs Improvement

Based on my actual work experience, I recognize that I need to focus on overcoming the following 3 weaknesses to improve myself:

* **Enhancing discipline and compliance with processes:**
    * *Current situation:* Sometimes negligent in strictly adhering to administrative regulations or company schedules.
    * *Action:* I commit to cultivating professional work habits, strictly complying with AWS regulations as well as any future organization, viewing this as the core foundation of professionalism.

* **Improving problem-solving mindset:**
    * *Current situation:* When the system encounters complex bugs, I often handle them with temporary fixes rather than in-depth analysis.
    * *Action:* I will cultivate systematic logical thinking, learn to analyze root causes (Root Cause Analysis) before fixing code to provide optimal and sustainable solutions.

* **Learning to communicate more effectively:**
    * *Current situation:* Communication skills in daily work and handling situations are sometimes awkward and not concise.
    * *Action:* I will actively participate in group discussions, learn to listen and present issues concisely and clearly so that information is conveyed most accurately to colleagues.
