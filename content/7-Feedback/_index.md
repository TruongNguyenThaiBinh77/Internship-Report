>Here, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program, helping the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:

### I. Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The environment at FCJ is very professional and technology-oriented ("Builder culture"). I was impressed by the openness in communication, where interns are encouraged to express opinions on technical solutions rather than just following instructions. The workspace stimulates creativity, and access to AWS Cloud resources is always available. However, due to the high-tech nature of the project, the work atmosphere can sometimes be tense. I think having some short "Happy Hour" activities mid-week would help everyone relieve pressure better.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
Mentors play a very important role in my development. As a Frontend role requiring integration with many complex AWS services, I frequently encountered difficulties. The mentor was very patient, not only pointing out errors but also guiding me on how to think to find root causes (Root Cause Analysis). The Admin team supports processes very efficiently, helping me focus entirely on my professional work.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The Frontend Developer role in the VoltGo project is completely aligned with my major but at a much higher "hands-on" level. From only knowing how to write simple interface code, I learned to think about System Integration, security with Cognito, and optimizing user experience on the Cloud platform. This is a knowledge foundation that schools cannot fully provide.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
This is the period when I learned the most so far. Professionally, I became more proficient with React Native, Next.js, and the AWS ecosystem. In terms of soft skills, I learned Agile work processes, source code management, and most importantly, understood how the standards of a commercial product (stability, scalability) differ greatly from student projects.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The spirits of "Customer Obsession" and "Ownership" from AWS are clearly spread throughout the team. People support each other regardless of rank. There were times when I made mistakes affecting the overall progress, but instead of blaming me, the whole team rallied to help me fix bugs. This made me feel accepted and motivated to improve my discipline.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
For me, the most valuable benefit here is not material, but the opportunity to 'immerse myself' in an environment of top Cloud experts. Working daily alongside experienced Mentors, directly observing how they think and solve tricky problems are invaluable 'professional' lessons that books cannot teach. This is truly a 'gold mine' of knowledge that significantly shortens my self-learning time.

### II. Additional Questions

**What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**  
The feeling of "Ownership". I was given real responsibility for important features on the App and Web Dashboard, the code I wrote runs on actual systems, not just simulated exercises.

**What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**  
I think the program should add more soft-skill training sessions ("Soft-skill workshops") from the beginning of the term, especially on Time Management and Workplace Discipline. Many technical students like me, when first entering, are often overwhelmed and don't know how to organize work scientifically, leading to unnecessary pressure.

**If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?**  
Definitely YES. This is an ideal environment to "push" yourself to mature. Although the pressure is high, the knowledge about Cloud and professional work processes gained after 3 months will be invaluable baggage for your career later.

### III. Suggestions & Expectations

**Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**  
I suggest Mentors could establish periodic "Check-point 1:1" sessions every 2 weeks not only to review code but also to review attitude and work style. Receiving early and straightforward feedback on discipline or communication will help interns recognize weaknesses and adjust promptly before the end of the internship.

**Would you like to continue this program in the future?**  
I very much hope to have the opportunity to return to AWS or continue working with FCJ in a higher position after I have improved my lacking skills and graduated.

**Any other comments (free sharing):**  
Thank you to the FCJ Team and Mentors for creating such a beneficial playground. Although I still have many limitations in terms of discipline and communication during this time, everyone's patience is the greatest lesson I have received. Wishing the program continued success!

Closing my journey at FCJ, I want to express my deepest gratitude to the dedicated mentors who have helped me complete this journey fully.

Special thanks to brothers: Nguyễn Gia Hưng, Văn Hoàng Kha, and all the mentors. Thank you for always supporting me enthusiastically, day and night, from the smallest processes to guiding strategic thinking.

Your patience and encouragement are the most valuable gifts I have received. Wishing the Admin and Mentor team of FCJ good health and success!
